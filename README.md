# SE-homework
This is the initial submission of the introductory website.

There were two updates made after the initial commit.  The first was to update the files to add criteria that wasn't apparent in the assignment pages but was listed on the submission page.  The second was to ifx the directory structure of the first update to match the initial commit.
